Lunar Landings is a small overhaul which has you build a second base on Nauvis' moon: Luna.

After launching a rocket (brought forwards to chemical science), you gain control of a robot on Luna, which can be switched to at any time. You must mine moon rock to create silicon, required by processing units. After completing utility and production sciences, start producing aluminium from rich moon rock using heat-outputting arc furnaces, and use telescopes placed on Luna mountains to generate data for space science. Utilise astrocrystals and polaritons to research quantum technologies, and then finally launch an interstellar rocket from Luna to win the game.

### How does this compare to [Space Exploration](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/space-exploration)?
Lunar Landings is a completely standalone mod. Some parts may look similar because it uses some graphics from SE, and since both mods involve building on other planets, there is some gameplay overlap.
Lunar Landings is _significantly_ shorter and easier. No changes are made to vanilla until chemical science, and only 2 new science packs are added (compared to SE's 22).

### How does this compare to [Space Age](https://factorio.com/blog/post/fff-373)?
Lunar Landings shares a similar design philosophy to the upcoming Space Age expansion in that it adds a specific named planet, with its own challenges and limitations, and is a natural extension of vanilla gameplay. LL and SA will be compatible in the future.

# Information

## Features
- Cheaper & smaller rocket silo, with reusable rocket parts
- Moon rock, processed into silicon, stone, and oxygen
- Oxygen diffusers, provide oxygen to nearby machines
- Ice, can be mined and melted to provide water
- Rich moon rock, processed into aluminium, iron, and moon rock
- Arc furnaces, required for aluminium processing and output heat as a byproduct
- Mass driver, used to deliver construction items to Luna based on requests
- Steam condenser, for recovering water from steam turbines
- Astrocrystals, processed into quantum things...

## Other mods
Lunar Landings is not compatible with any other overhaul mods. If you would like to contribute compatibility with another mod, please get in touch.

If you want additional complexity, consider adding [AAI Industry](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/aai-industry) or [Planetfall's ores and intermediates mods](https://mods.factorio.com/user/planetfall). These mods are compatible, but may not have been as thoroughly tested for bugs and balance.

Also incompatible with beacon overhaul mods such as [Beacon Rebalance](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/wret-beacon-rebalance-mod) for technical reasons, due to the implementation of LL's oxygen diffusers. If you want to try a beacon overhaul, [Alternative Beacons](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/alternative-beacons) is compatible.

For quality of life, you are free to choose your own. You can see my general recommendations [here](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/X-QoL).
